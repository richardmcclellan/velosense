Haptic Feedback Handlebars (Built for YC Upverter Hackathon)

This app connects to a BTLE Development Board that had two vibrating motors attached to it.  These motors were installed inside the handlebars of a bicycle.  Once the app connected to the bicycle, the user could input a destination, and it would use the Google Maps API to download driving directions and show them to the user.  Then, when you tap on an instruction step requiring a left turn, the motor in the left handlebar would vibrate.  When you tap an instruction requiring a right turn, the right handlebar would vibrate.  The ultimate goal was to use GPS region monitoring to trigger the vibrations as the rider approached an intersection.
